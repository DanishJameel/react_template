# Project Summary
The project is now a dedicated web application named **"Medical Appointment Booking"**, designed to facilitate voice interactions for scheduling medical appointments. By integrating the Vapi AI voice agent, users can seamlessly interact with an AI assistant through voice commands, enhancing the booking experience with a modern and user-friendly interface.

# Project Module Description
The main module of the project includes:
- **Vapi AI Voice Agent Integration**: Embeds a voice assistant focused on medical appointment booking that responds to user queries through voice.
- **User Interface Components**: A simplified interface with a phone icon for initiating voice interactions, eliminating the conversation history display.
- **Event Handling**: Listens for voice interaction events such as speech start/end and call start/end.
